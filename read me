we will be creating a totally new personal ink tree page for me. With a minimalistic dark mode + ultra-smooth animations approach, the goal is to make the page feel premium, effortless, and modern while keeping it lightweight and functional. 

1. Layout & Structure (Keep It Simple & Elegant)
Centered UI: A single column with links appearing dynamically.
Whitespace & Padding: Generous spacing for a high-end feel.
Subtle Grid or Lines: Faint dividers or motion-based grid effects for structure.
2. GLSL Shader (Elegant & Subtle, Not Overpowering)
Soft, Organic Light Waves that subtly distort or illuminate the background on interaction.
Glassmorphism Effect where links reveal through a frosted-glass overlay.
Minimal Bloom or Glow when links appear (smooth but not flashy).
3. Animations (Ultra-Smooth, Natural Motion)
GSAP for Smooth Transitions (e.g., easing links in and out).
Slow Hover Expansions instead of instant color shifts.
Microinteractions: A gentle vibration, fade-in, or slide effect when links are revealed.
4. Typography & Styling
Font: A modern sans-serif like Inter, Neue Montreal, or Helvetica Now.
Colors: A deep black/dark gray background with dimmed white text (not pure white, to reduce eye strain).
Accent Colors: One subtle primary color (e.g., dimmed gold, blue-gray, or desaturated cyan).
5. Mobile Optimization (Crucial for Freelance Clients!)
Tap-based GLSL Interaction instead of hover for mobile.
Fast-loading animations (no excessive JS blocking UI).
Thumb-friendly design with large tappable areas.  Recommended Libraries
1. Animations & Smooth Transitions
GSAP (GreenSock) – The best for ultra-smooth animations, easing, and staggered effects.
Lenis – Smooth scroll library for fluid motion.
Three.js – If you want advanced GLSL control and 3D interaction.
2. UI & Effects
Locomotive Scroll – Adds buttery-smooth scrolling and subtle parallax effects.
Tailwind CSS – If you want a fast, utility-first approach to styling.
Framer Motion – If you're considering React; great for declarative animations.
3. GLSL Shader Helpers
ShaderToy – For experimenting with GLSL shaders before integrating.
GlslCanvas – WebGL framework for embedding shaders into HTML.
Color Palette Recommendations (Minimalist & Professional)
For a modern, general-audience appeal, we’ll focus on dark neutrals with a subtle accent:

1. Base (Background) Colors
#121212 (Deep Black) – Main background, very dark without harsh contrast.
#1A1A1A (Soft Black) – Slightly softer for panels or sections.
#222831 (Charcoal Gray) – If you want a slight industrial tone.
2. Text & UI Elements
#E0E0E0 (Light Gray) – Primary text color (not pure white to reduce strain).
#B0B0B0 (Muted Gray) – For secondary text, descriptions.
#FFFFFF (Pure White) – Used sparingly for highlights.
3. Accent Colors (Choose One for a Subtle Highlight)
#00ADB5 (Muted Cyan) – Tech feel, modern, calming.
#FFAE42 (Muted Gold/Amber) – Classy, warm, and high-end.
